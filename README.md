# React Assignment

> This is a boilerplate repository for React Assignments that does not use any bundler such as Webpack/parcel. But simply uses babel for compilation before putting it up for deployment.

Welcome to React Assignment

Throughout your practical and assignment, you will be expected to build upon these code. Let's get started by setting up the project and familiarize yourself with making submissions.

## Pre-requisite & Assumptions

1. I assume you are using `Visual Studio Code` ([Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

2. I assume you have installed the `live server` VSCode plugin ([Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer))

3. I assume you have registered for a GitHub account and has finished setting up of GitHub desktop ([Link](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop))

## To start

1. Execute `npm install`
2. Execute `npm start`
3. Open index.html in Live Server

## Uploading your progress

In `git` terminology, to upload your progress is simply to `push` your `commits` to where you `cloned` the repository from. No worries if those terminologies are foreign to you, we will simply use `GitHub Desktop` to do so.

1. Select changes you want to include in your next version ([Link](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#selecting-changes-to-include-in-a-commit))

2. Write a commit and push ([Link](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#write-a-commit-message-and-push-your-changes))

    1. Write a summary (required) and if it contains a lot of changes, add a description too (optional)

    2. Commit your changes

    3. Push your changes to origin by pressing `Push origin`

3. That's it! Head back to GitHub to see your changes uploaded
